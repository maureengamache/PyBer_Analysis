## PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
* Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

* Software: Python 3.10.6, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Lab

## Analysis and Results
Overall, the urban cities have the most rides, while the rural cities have the least rides. Additionally, the urban cities have the most drivers, while the rural cities have the least drivers. Total revenue (fares) is the highest in the urban cities and the lowest in the rural citites. However, when looking at the average fare per ride and the average fare per dirver the rural cities have a higher per ride fare and per driver fare, than the urban cities. Suburban cities are steadily in the "middle" for all catergories of interest, falling between urban and rural citites for total rides, drivers, and fares; and between rural and urban cities, for average fare per ride and average fare per driver (see *figure 1* below). 

When analyzing, total fare by city type (see *figure 2* below), the same results were noted for the urban cities, having the highest total fare week by week from January to April, followed by the suburban cities and the rural cities having the lowest fares by city type week by week from January to April. Upon review of the line graph. it is noted that the fares are the highest in rural cities at the beginning of April. The fares in suburban cities are highest at the end of Feburary, and the fares in urban cities are the highest end of February and the beginning of March. Conversely, the lowest fares by city type week by week from January to April, are January, for both urban and rural cities, March for suburban cities.

## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
