# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources
* Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

* Software: Python 3.10.6, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Lab
